<h2>Dear <?php echo $sections['Customer Details']['Customer Name']?>,</h2>

<div class="email-body">
  <p>Congratulations on selling your car! We hope the sale was easy and stress free!</p>

  <p>Attached is a copy of the contract you signed​.​ Please keep this for your records.</p>

  <p>This is a courtesy email to let you know that we have received your paperwork and it is currently with our Administration team. We are conducting the necessary checks on your vehicle, which include an ownership check and a PPSR check to make sure the vehicle is not stolen, written off or under any unexpected finance. Once verified, we will arrange payment into your nominated bank account and then advise you of when your vehicle will be collected.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, if you have any questions or queries please call the team on 03 9681 8129 and we would be happy to assist you.</p>

  <p>We look forward to helping you again in the future.</p>

  <p>Finally, if you recommend us to someone​ who goes on to sell their car to us we will send you a $100 Coles / Myer gift card as a thank you. Please tell them to notify us of your name as the referrer at the time of sale.
  </p>
